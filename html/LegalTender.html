                  <b>Low-Poly Platypus</b> was a <b>2nd year team</b> formed by 15 members, this included 
                  <b>3 Programmers, 3 Designers, 2 3D Modellers, 4 Artists, 1 Writer, 1 Animator and 1 Audio Designer</b>. As a team we worked on <b>Legal Tender</b> <br><br>

                  For <b>Legal Tender</b> my main role was a <b>gameplay</b> and <b>AI programmer</b>. This included working on the <b>weapon system, ability system</b> and the <b>enemy AI</b>.

                <p>
                  One area I worked on for legal tender was the weapon system. For this system I utilised scriptable objects to hold and store the data of each weapon. 
                  I made use of inheritance to create a parent weapon data object which held data that would be used by all the weapons, 
                  whilst creating child classes that would add the extra data needed for the different types of weapons. <br><br>

                  For the system I also created a base weapon class which had all the weapon functionality, 
                  this was then used to create child classes which would alter the weapon fire function in order to create the different weapons we wanted within the game. 
                  This included an assault rifle, burst rifle, shotgun, pistol and a grenade launcher.

                <p>
                  In addition to the weapon system, 
                  I also worked on the ability system which was set up in a similar way to the weapon system where basic information is stored in the 
                  scriptable object for the cooldown. The scripts themselves are then are children of a parent ability class that add the extra data 
                  that is needed for each of the abilities in which we had 4 different ones. <br><br>

                  These abilities ranged from a charge that had impact damage, a weapon with bouncing bullets, a special grenade and player stat increases.

                <h2 class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-title">Enemy AI</h2>
                <p>
                  For the enemy AI I used a state machine that utilised scriptable objects to define each state as this would allow 
                  for each state to be easily edited in the inspector, allowing for each state to have list of actions that would be performed 
                  as well as a list of decisions which would determine whether the state should be remained in or transition to another state.<br><br>

                  This therefore allowed different actions and decisions to be made that would use the same scriptable object class but have different values within them, 
                  for instance the “DistanceDecision” could be used to check if the AI got too close to the player but could also be used to check if they were too 
                  far away and if the AI should stop following the player.

                <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                  In the early stages of development an Event System was designed by another programmer. 
                  This system became one of the core systems utilised throughout the project as it allowed us to reduce the number of dependencies 
                  within our code base and allowed for other disciplines to expand off events that are already in place such as taking damage.<br><br>
  
                  In general, I feel the weapons worked quite well allowing for many variants to be created and allow for more weapon classes to be developed 
                  with the main improvement needed being the weapon UX for when the weapons are reloading.

                <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                  A improvement I that would have helped the game massively in looks is getting art assets in earlier on to allow for multiple art passes
                  to be done rather than waiting closer to the end which is when the game felt like it was taking shape. <br><br> 

                  Another improvement would have been to redo some AI states as when the AI states were designed it was with the Idea of stealth being involved 
                  in the early stages of the heist, so as the game progressed the stealth became less relevant leaving the AI in a confusing state.
