                BladeGunners is a first-person, online arena shooter game. It utilises skating movement mechanics
                to allow for rail grinding on certain objects in the arena which will charge up the player's energy-based weapon. Set in
                the distant future where bullets are a thing of the past, private weapons manufacturers seek to covertly field test their
                weapons through gameshow sponsorships. Players are placed into 2 teams of 4 and must face each other in a deathmatch for
                the highly desired grand prize.

                For <b>BladeGunners</b> my main role has been a <b>gameplay programmer</b>. 
                This has included working on the <b>player movement</b>, <b>weapons</b>, and <b>network programming</b>. <br> <br>  
                Additionally, to this I have worked alongside other members of the team to <b>pair develop</b> and <b>bug fix</b> different mechanics such as the <b>health system</b>
                and implementing a <b>prototype</b> of the <b>rail grinding mechanic</b> with a designer and getting it work over the <b>network</b>.

              <h2 class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-title">Player Movement </h2>
              <p>
              The first mechanic I worked on for BladeGunners was the player movement system. As we wanted to try and simulate roller skating, 
              this meant that we wanted to let the player to get to a top speed through regular means but then be able to move faster than this speed 
              when utilising different options within the levels this included the rail grinding, half pipes and slopes. <br><br>

              As this project is still in development the conservation of momentum is still a work in progress that has not yet been fully explored. 
              However, the basics of the movement allowing for a more “floatier” feel has been worked on which stops players from coming to an instant stop
              and adds more of a circular cornering compared to other systems where you don’t build speed and instead have a much more linear 
              path when moving round a corner.

              <h2 class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-title">Weapon System</h2>
              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                The next mechanic that was my main goal was the weapon system as we wanted to have three weapons in by the end of study block one, 
                this included the assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. We wanted these three weapons in first as this gives us the basics of our weapon diversity 
                as they are the weapons commonly found in arena shooters. On top of these three weapons, we are also looking to include a pistol, 
                DMR and rocket launcher. <br><br>

                To build the weapon system effectively I utilised inheritance to create the base weapon C++ class that each weapon would 
                inherit from to create their own C++ class before making a blueprint of those classes. 
                The weapons can then be used by myself and other members of the team to balance and modify weapons. <br><br>

                On top of the making the weapons functional I also worked on developing a recoil system, 
                which utilises the built in UE4 timelines to move the players camera to create a recoil pattern. 
                On top of this I added bullet spread so that the bullets don’t always hit the same point when fired but follow a pattern so 
                that its more predictable where they will be landing. 
                Additional functionality includes adding the ability to ADS with the sniper rifle and the spread shot on the shotgun.

              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                As BladeGunners is an online first-person shooter, it’s meant that it’s my first project to include any type of online networking. 
                This has meant I’ve had to investigate what actions should be done client side, server side and on both ends to create systems that work over network. <br><br>

                All the mechanics that have currently been implemented have also manged to be fully networked. 
                With this being a new area for our team we have all sat down and helped each other with networking to ensure that systems work correctly 
                including prototype systems such as the rail grinding.

              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                As a team I think that we all did an amazing job to pick up the engine quite quickly in our first study block
                and support each other with areas that others are unfamiliar with, as for the majority of the team it was their first time using Unreal Engine.<br><br>

                Personally, I am happy with how the weapon system is turning out as it allows for a lot of tweaks to be made through the blueprints
                which allows for multiple weapons to be created based off the same type of weapon which may want a different different recoil pattern, rate of fire, etc.

              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                So far during our first study block we have had a lack of playtesting due to hardware and software limitations that we were unaware of at the start of 
                the project. This included not being able to test over a LAN connection in the University's facilities due to firewall issues, as well as not doing our 
                reasearch with how to create a server only build so that we could run a dedicated server to playtest on, as this required a source build of UE4 which we 
                eventually solved close to the end of the study block. <br><br>
