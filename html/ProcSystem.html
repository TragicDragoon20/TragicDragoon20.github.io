                This was a solo project subbmitted for my COMP250: Artificial Intelligence module in second year. The goal of this module was to 
                design and implement a game component implementing one or more artifical intelligence techniques.<br><br>

                With this in mind I wanted to create a system which would produce solar systems similar to our own that would also use
                simulated gravity to hold the planets in orbit rather than placing them into a set loop.<br><br>

                We were also tasked with creating a research poster that would outline a problem with the solution being our artefact whilst including 
                at least one UML Diagram.</p><a href="../img/COMP250-Poster.pdf" target="_blank">View Poster</a>

              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                For the simulation of the gravity I opted to use a rigidbody and Newton's law of gravitation to calculate the acceleration 
                of the celestial bodies; as well as another formula to calculate the starting velocity of the celestial bodies so that they have 
                enough speed to start an orbit around the star in the system.

              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                In order to store the data about the planets I used scriptable objects which would be used to store any infomation that needed to be 
                calculated. The generation of the planets were then done by using constrained randomness based on the values calculated about each planet
                and values in our sysetm. For instance the hill sphere is used to constrain how close/far the bodies moons can be.

              <h2 class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-title">What Went well</h2>
              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                An area that went well in my opinion was the handling of the celestial bodies data as I used inheritance to create multiple types of scriptable 
                objects for all the different bodies which allowed me to choose which data was needed by all the bodies and which was only needed by one type of body.<br><br>

                Another area I'm happy with is the gravity simulation as it allows for any number of planets to be generated and all have gravity simulated around them and be 
                affected by the other bodies that are in the scene which allows for the orbits to be disturbed.

              <h2 class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-title">What Could be improved</h2>
              <p class="portfolio-page-content-contribution-text">
                An area I would like to improve is the spawning of the planets so that they aren't all spawned in a row and instead are at random points around the star<br><br>

                Another area I would want to improve on is some of the mesh generation as the planets are spawned with some terrain generated on to them; however, it was done 
                close to the end so it was left to simply add some hills to the planets but I would have liked it to add crators on the moons.<br><br>

                My final improvement would most likely be to change how the planets were spawned so that it wasn't constrained randomness as I feel that the solar system
                usually looks very similar to past generations.
